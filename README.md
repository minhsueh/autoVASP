Introduction:<br/>
While conducting the research for alloy material simulation, the massive calculation is needed for differenct composition and atomic ratio. <br/>
However, most of the calculation is similar except some little modification such as atom, atom position, and atom potential. <br/>
For systemically and consistently input parameters in VASP, these scripts were built for routine calculation for structure relaxation, optical properties calculation, <br/>
and post-processing analysis.<br/>
Also, these script meets PBS workload system requirements. (usually, one job is allocated in 8 CPU and 4 Nodes for time and memory requirement.)<br/>
